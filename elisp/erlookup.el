;;; erlookup.el

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module contains a naive, inefficient and buggy way to lookup macro and
;; record definitions. Sort of like M-. for functions.
;;
;; NOTE: This is a work in progress and stuff change all the time. There are
;; also a couple of known bugs. Since it makes use of simple and dumb regexps
;; for finding stuff it's easy finding definitions like '-defin

;; TODO: 'inline' lookups of macros to e.g. jump to record definitions when
;; standing on '#?name_of_record', and jump to function definitions when
;; standing on '?name_of_function(Foo, Bar)'.
;; TODO: Make everything less side-effecty.
